## Features

### Sunsual Chat Interface
Engage with our highly advanced, comedic AI in flirtatious banter that teaches the chatbot the subtle arts of charm and wit. Each interaction helps our AI become more adept at the language of love.

### Barry White Boost Plugin
When the going gets tough, the tough get charming. Activate this plugin to infuse your chat sessions with the smooth, soulful vibes of Barry White, significantly boosting your Rizz learning levels.

### MojoDB
Our custom database, built to store and analyze every successful (and hilarious) pick-up line, flirtatious joke, or romantic flop. MojoDB ensures that every piece of "Rizz" is cataloged for science... or at least for a good laugh.

### Flirtatious Feedback Algorithm
Every chat is followed by feedback on your Rizz performance. Think of it as getting wingman advice from a supercomputer.

### Love Metrics Dashboard
Track your progress in the art of Rizz with our Love Metrics Dashboard, which displays your most successful lines, your improvement over time, and areas where your charm could use a little polish.

### Cupidâ€™s Arrow Query Language (CAQL)
A specialized query language designed to retrieve your flirtatious exchanges with maximum efficiency. Perfect for revisiting your most charming moments or analyzing what went wrong.

### AmorAPI
Integrate the Rizz Chain with other applications using AmorAPI, allowing for the dissemination of Rizz techniques far and wide.
